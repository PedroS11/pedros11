# Hey, Im Pedro Oliveira da Silva 👋🏻 

A mainly backend developer but with some interest in frontend too. Currently, doing both with Typescript for an e-commerce company. Previously, a .Net Core/PL SQL developer for a health software company.

💻 As a backend, I worked with Docker and now with the AWS ecosystem (Lambdas, S3, Queues). As for front end, tried a bit of Vue but React is what I mostly use for work for my projects.
