# Hey, Im Pedro Oliveira da Silva üëãüèª 

A mainly backend developer but with some interest in frontend too. Currently, doing both with Typescript on an ecommerce company. Previously, a .Net Core/PL SQL developer for an health software company.

üíª As backend, I worked with Docker and now with AWS ecosystem (Lambdas, S3, Queues). As for frontend, tried a bit of Vue but React is what I mostly use for work as for my personal projects.
